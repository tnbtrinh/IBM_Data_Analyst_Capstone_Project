# IBM DATA ANALYST CAPSTONE PROJECT
This Capstone provides a practical hands on experience to demonstrate all of the skills I have picked up so far in the IBM Professional Certificate program. As part of the capstone project, I will take on the role of a Data Analyst with a global IT and Business Services firm.
In this role, I will be analyzing several datasets to help identify trends for emerging technologies. Once I have collected enough data, I will begin analyzing the data and identify insights and trends that may include the following: What are the top programming languages in demand? What are the top database skills in demand? What are the popular IDEs?

I will begin by scraping internet web sites and accessing APIs to collect data in various formats like .csv files, excel sheets, and databases. Once this is completed, I will make that data ready for analysis using data wrangling techniques. When the data is ready I will then apply statistical techniques to analyze the data.
